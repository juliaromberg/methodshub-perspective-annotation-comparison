    "Data annotation is an essential prerequisite for developing and evaluating machine learning approaches to answer social science questions. Traditionally, agreement between annotators in choosing labels for data points has long been interpreted as a measure of reliability, based on the assumption that all annotators should behave in the same way (i.e., following the so-called prescriptive paradigm of data annotation). However, in case of more subjective tasks, different groups of annotators may exhibit differing annotation behaviors. This can be due to various reasons, such as differing levels of affectedness or experiences, and is increasingly being considered valuable information (i.e., following the so-called descriptive paradigm of data annotation).\n",

    "## Basic concepts you should know for this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is data annotation?** Enriching raw datasets with additional information tags is a common method of data analysis and builds the foundation for training and testing many machine learning algorithms. For example, to study hate speech in social media, posts (=raw data) are manually reviewed for whether they contain hate speech (=additional information tags). These tags are called annotations, labels, or codes (interchangeably).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two paradigms of data annotation (\"objective\" vs. \"subjective\")**\n",
    "Dataset annotation can be conducted with two different paradigms in mind (Röttger et al., 2022):\n",
    "    - **Prescriptive annotation** is the longstanding and more common paradigm of data annotation. The goal is to achieve a consistent annotation across the dataset, e.g., through meticulous decision rules predefined in codebooks. The general credo is that there is always *exactly one correct assessment*; for example, in hate speech, each statement can be clearly categorized as such or not containing hate speech. The phenomenon is therefore assumed to be capturable in an objective manner.\n",
    "    - **Descriptive annotation** has gained attention more recently, as it has become more and more obvious that subjective phenomena may more accurately be reflected by capturing a multitude of annotators' perspectives. The reason behind is that certain properties of an individual can shape the perception of a phenomenon. For instance, consider a white man and a black woman---it seems reasonable to expect that there may be cases of hate speech that these individuals assess differently. According to the paradigm, there can be *multiple valid assessments*, which are kept as additional source of information for real-world modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    With our goal of comparing group-specific annotation behaviour, we follow the descriptive annotation paradigm in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ground truth formats**\n",
    "Related to the two paradigms of annotation, the \"end product\" of a data annotation pipeline looks different.\n",
    "    - **Aggregated ground truth:** In prescriptive annotation, the annotations from multiple annotators are consolidated to create a single ground truth---typically by using methods such as majority voting or averaging the assigned scores. We refer to this as the *aggregated* ground truth.\n",
    "    - **Non-Aggregated ground truth:** In descriptive annotation, the labels provided by multiple annotators may all be considered valid and are therefore not merged. Instead, each data point is associated with multiple labels. We refer to this as the *non-aggregated* ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What this tutorial means by annotator groups**\n",
    "A set of individuals who share similar traits (such as demographics, experiences, values, or beliefs) and are thus expected to annotate more similarly to one another than to those with different traits, under the descriptive annotation paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inter-annotator agreement measures** To assess how uniformly or diversely annotators work, *inter-annotator agreement measures* are typically used. These measures provide a score indicating how likely it is that multiple annotators make the same annotation decision on the same data items.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Note: While inter-annotator agreement measures inform us about the degree of agreement between annotators, they are commonly used as a proxy for reliability in prescriptive annotations: the more the annotators agree, the more consistent the annotation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    For a general overview of inter-annotator agreement measures and mathematical details, see: Artstein & Poesio (2008). We will use two selected measures in this tutorial (*in other use cases than provided in this tutorial, a different choice of measure might be more suitable*):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Krippendorff's Alpha** is one of the most well-known inter-annotator agreement measure. It can handle sparse annotations and varying amounts of annotators per item (i.e., cases in which not all annotators worked on every data item; as the tutorial progresses and we look at datasets, the reason for this requirement will become clear).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Conceptually, Krippendorff's Alpha integrates the observed disagreement between annotators with the amount of disagreement that is expected to happen by chance, thus providing a chance-corrected agreement coefficient in the range from -1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates *perfect agreement between annotators*, -1 *systematic disagreement*, and 0 *random agreement*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Wasserstein distance**, also known as Earth Mover's distance, is a distance measure for comparing probability distributions. Conceptually, it quantifies the minimum amount of \"work\" needed to transform one distribution into another, where \"work\" is defined as the amount of mass transported multiplied by the distance it is moved. The higher the distance value, *the more dissimal the distributions are*; 0 indicates *identical distributions*. Unlike Krippendorff’s Alpha, the Wasserstein distance does not have a fixed scale for possible interpretation, as its values are data-dependent. For instance, if annotations are on a 1–5 scale, a Wasserstein distance of 1.5 indicates a significant difference between annotators. But on a broader scale, like 0–100, that same value would reflect only a small disagreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "        *Note: The Wasserstein distance is not a classical inter-annotator agreement measure. Unlike Krippendorff's Alpha, it does not include chance correction, and may therefore overestimate the similarity between two distributions. The development of distribution-based inter-annotator agreement measures is an active area of research.*"

    "### Argument quality assessment (example task 2)\n",
    "Argument quality refers to the strength, clarity, relevance, and validity of reasoning and evidence presented to support a claim or position. Argument quality assessment is the task of evaluating how good an argument is and it can be measured across multiple dimensions (see Wachsmuth et al., 2017a).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "We use the *Dagstuhl-ArgQuality* dataset (Wachsmuth et al., 2017b), which consists of 304 English arguments from online debate portals. Each item was annotated for each category of argument quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Annotation categories (indicators)\n",
    "We here focus on four selected categories of argument quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity**\n",
    "    - *Definition:* Argumentation is deemed clear if it uses correct and widely unambiguous language as well as if it avoids unnecessary complexity and deviation from the issue it addresses.\n",
    "    - *Annotation scale:*\n",
    "        - 3 - high quality\n",
    "        - 2 - medium quality\n",
    "        - 1 - low quality\n",
    "2. **Credibility**\n",
    "    - *Definition:* Argumentation is deemed credible if it conveys arguments in a way that makes the author worthy of credence.\n",
    "    - *Annotation scale:*\n",
    "        - 3 - high quality\n",
    "        - 2 - medium quality\n",
    "        - 1 - low quality\n",
    "3. **Effectiveness**\n",
    "    - *Definition:* Argumentation is deemed effective if it persuades the audience of or corroborates agreement with the author’s stance on the issue.\n",
    "    - *Annotation scale:*\n",
    "        - 3 - high quality\n",

    "#### Groups\n",
    "The dataset has been annotated by different groups of annotators over the years. We make use of this by relying on one group consisting of 3 annotators who are experts in argument quality (Wachsmuth et al., 2017b), and another group of 108 annotators who were novices in the field (Mirzakhmedova et al., 2024).\n",

    "#### Research question\n",
    "Is there a difference in label variation between experts, in this case senior researchers that are very familiar with the construct, and novices, in this case undergraduate students that were newly introduced to the construct. We hypothesize that expert annotators label in a more homogeneous way than novices. \n",

    "# How do label distributions differ between groups?\n",
    "So far, we have investigated the inter-annotator agreement scores for different reference populations: for all annotators, regardless of demographics, as well as separately for female and male annotators. We have also compared these scores across the different groups. **To sum up: we have learnt how we can analyze and interpret agreement within and across groups.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We now go one step further and ask: can we directly compare how similar or dissimilar annotation decisions in two distinct groups are? The goal is to take into account the full range of *non-aggregated* label decisions, assuming that different groups have unique distributions across labels. **Fully following the descriptive approach of data annotation, we therefore directly compare the label distributions between the two annotator groups.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: For the following analysis, it is assumed that all label decisions are valid assessments.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## We employ the Wasserstein distance for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wasserstein distance allows to compare group-specific labeling patterns while embracing the diversity of label decisions for individual data points. It thereby acts in a *non-aggregated manner*, valuing the diversity of perceptions (remember: we follow the descriptive approach).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use a non-aggregated approach like this?** In the short excursus on \"effectiveness\" (see above), we have built aggregate labels per data point through the mean of all annotators. For example, experts rated the argument \"it is true that bottled water is a waste, but bottles can be reused!\" for \"effectiveness\" with labels 1, 1, and 2, yielding a mean of 1.33. Interpreted, this means that it is not accepted that for some experts the perceived effectiveness is higher than for others. As a result, this approach discards valuable information about existing label variation; it *denies the existence of multiple valid asssessments*. Wasserstein distance retains this information."

    "# Discussion and Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explored two methods for comparing groups of annotators based on their labeling behavior. We began with the established Krippendorff’s Alpha to measure agreement within selected annotator groups and in the overall population of annotators, analyzing whether differences exist between groups. We then applied the Wasserstein distance as a metric to directly measure the distance between group-specific label distributions, allowing us to compare differences in labeling behavior at a non-aggregated level per annotation unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research question (example task 1)\n",
    "Is there a difference in annotation behavior for hate speech between women and men annotators? We hypothesize that, as women may more frequently be targeted by hate speech, they may perceive and annotate it differently than men.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The analysis indicates that woman are more consistent in their level of inter-annotator agreement across the indicator dimensions (i.e., respect, insult, humiliate, and violence). While the Krippendorff's Alpha scores are more similar for some indicators (i.e., insult and respect), for others we observe greater label variety, especially within the male annotator group (i.e., humiliate and violence). Examining the label probability distributions directly, we find further evidence of group-specific label patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research question (example task 2)\n",
    "Is there a difference in label variation between experts, in this case senior researchers that are very familiar with the construct, and novices, in this case undergraduate students that were newly introduced to the construct. We hypothesize that expert annotators label in a more homogeneous way than novices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Generally, argument quality assessment proves to be very subjective. The novice annotators achieve lower inter-annotator agreement scores in general, presumably due to their lack in expertise. However, for \"emotional appeal\", both groups agree closely, which may suggest that expertise---at least for this indicator of argument quality---is not crucial. Examining the label probability distributions directly, we find that in particular the assessment of \"effectiveness\" exhibits more dissimilar label patterns within the distinct groups. One reason may be a more intuitive assessment of novices vs. a more theory-driven assessment by experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further thoughts\n",
    "- Following on from the previous paragraph, it becomes clear that it is essential to consider the target application from the outset of data creation. If we aim to implement a system that assesses argument quality in, e.g., social media posts from a theoretical perspective, experts may be the most appropriate choice of annotators. Conversely, if we want to capture lay people's perception of argument quality, novices or crowdworkers may be more suitable.\n",
    "- To derive meaningful general conclusions from studying annotator groups, it is important to ensure a large enough sample of annotators and a careful selection.\n",
    "- Annotation errors occur regularly. It is important to understand that---even in the descriptive annotation paradigm---not all variation is due to subjectivity. Distuingishing errors from valid disagreement is an ongoing field of research.\n",
    "- It is also important to note that you won't always find that groups agree more within themselves than with other groups. For example, you can see this by looking into the \"humiliate\" dimension. This dimension generates higher agreement between the female and male groups than within the novice group itself."
